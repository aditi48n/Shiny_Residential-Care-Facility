# Shiny_Residential-Care-Facility

This repository contains a shiny app developed by Aditi Nagaraj Nallan as part of [Assignment B3](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/assignments/assignment-b3/) in the UBC graduate course [STAT 545](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/). 

For this assignment, I have chosen option B which is- develop your own app. Below, I have provided a link to access the app along with some information about the app. 

The app is currently deployed on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) and can be accessed using this [link](https://aditi-nagaraj.shinyapps.io/shiny-aditi48n/?_ga=2.226158047.412501495.1637968541-164894795.1637870183).

In a nutshell, this app is designed to allow users access to information currently displayed on the Residential Care Programs Map. At the moment, this app only performs the basic functions of filtering information based on two citerias, displaying and downloading filtered data. Further developments to the app will include incorporating more extensive filtering and better user experience. 


## Motivation

The main purpose of this application is to make it easier for families to look for residential care facilities across British Columbia, Canada. The application provides details on the types of facilities available, the cities they are available in along with information on the location, website and contact details for each facility.


## Data 

The data for this application was obtained from [OpenDataBC](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/residential-care-facilities). The raw data along with the code and any other relevant information have been made available for public use in this github repository.
